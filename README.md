## Citing Free Software?

Interesting discussion here http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/matplotlib-at-LIGO-GW-observation-td46749.html  
on how and why citing free software (and thus matplotlib for instance) you use. One recommandation looks fine with me:
putting like the following sentence in the Acknowledgments: 

"The author(s) thank the contributors of Matplotlib [Hunter:2007] for making the software freely available."
